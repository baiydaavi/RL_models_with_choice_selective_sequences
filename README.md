# Models of decision making using choice-selective sequences

## How to use?

I strongly suggest creating a new conda environment before installing all the Python dependencies. Follow these steps to create a conda environment and install all the python dependencies:

1. Create a new conda environment - ```conda create -n env_name python=3.9.4``` (replace ```env_name``` with the desired environment name).
2. Activate the new conda environment - ```conda activate env_name```
3. Install all the python dependencies - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You are now ready to run all the python scripts. Please remember to install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the notebooks.
